## Sample React-Redux hiring dashboard app.

This application is created for demo purposes. To use the repo run commands in the following order:

1. npm i - it will install all the required dependencies
2. npm start - this step will fire eslint first, then unit tests, and then it will run webpack dev server with the app itself.
